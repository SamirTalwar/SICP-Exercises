For small values, both versions of the `expmod` function will work. However, for large values, Alyssa's version will take a very long time, as it will calculate the power before performing any remainder operations. As the numbers increase in size (for example, 1000000^1000000), this will take longer and longer. In the original function, a remainder operation is performed after each multiplication, meaning the numbers stay small and easy to multiply further.
