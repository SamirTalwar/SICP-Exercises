Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
=================================================

Exercise solutions by Samir Talwar, in Clojure
==============================================

This project is an attempt to both read the famous book on programming, [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*][SICP], and learn Clojure. To do this, I will be completing the exercises in the book using Clojure instead of Scheme.
